## Intro

Badger is a secure identity vault for Bitcoin Cash. It allows you to hold BCH & tokens, and serves as your bridge to decentralized applications (dapps).

Bitcoin Cash and tokens enable an entirely new dimension to the web with micro-payments, smart-assets, decentralized exchanges, distributed autonomous organizations and much more.

Badger is your identiy on this new web. You can pay for premium content, run smart contracts and experience dapps seemlessly and trust free.

Powered by BITBOX, Badger is 100% non-custodial. You're private keys never leave your computer.

## $BGR

$BGR is the utility token of the Badger platform. Dapps which accept $BGR will get discounted time on BITBOX Cloud. Users can fund Badger w/ $BGR and as they navigate the web they can use dapps seemlesly.

## Badger Button

Badger Button is a library of open source UI components which content creators and entreprenuers can drop in to their site to enable micro payments, premium content, tipping, e-commerce and much more.
